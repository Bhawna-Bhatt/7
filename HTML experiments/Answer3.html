    <h3>What is the moral of the story ?</h3>
    <p>When we attach a negative label or meaning to a certain event, our own perceptions cause us pain and makes us
        suffer.
        As the farmerâ€™s story illustrates, it is wise to refrain from attaching any negative meaning to the events that
        occur in our lives. </p>
