    <h1> The story of the Chinese farmer and the horse </h1>
    <h2> Sneak Peak </h2>
    <p> The farmer's story illustrates, it is wise to refrain
        from attaching any meaning to life events</p>
    <h2> The Story </h2>
    <p> Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away.
        That evening, all of his neighbours came around to commiserate.
        They said, “We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away.
        This is most unfortunate.” The farmer said,<span id="bigdeal"> “Maybe.”</span></span></p>
    <p> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it,
        and in the evening everybody came back and said, “Oh, isn’t that lucky.
        What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!” The farmer again said,
        “Maybe.” The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it,
        he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, “Oh dear, that’s too bad,” and the farmer responded,
        “Maybe.” </p>
    <p>The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and
        they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbours came around and
        said, “Isn’t that great!” Again, he said, “Maybe.”</p>
